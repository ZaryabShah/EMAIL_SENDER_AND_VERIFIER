SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: law@eques.law
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: FORECLOSURE), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Meghan Cozens was selected as the best match because her role as HOA/Litigation Paralegal includes direct experience with foreclosures, enforcement matters, and HOA litigation, which directly aligns with the firm's foreclosure practice area. She is likely involved in client communications and case management for new cases in this area, making her senior enough and relevant for handling new client intake related to foreclosure matters.",
"search_notes": "Started with browsing the main website eques.law and our-team page, which provided a list of legal staff. Used web searches to find additional profiles on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and legal directories. Browsed individual staff pages for bios and details. Searched X for mentions in posts. Found general contact email but no individual emails except one; generated options based on common patterns. Focused on cross-referencing sources to confirm roles and backgrounds, especially for foreclosure-related experience."
