Given the firm's focus on employment law and the query's practice area listed as 'OTHER' (potentially encompassing general employment matters), her role suggests seniority in support functions and direct involvement in legal processes, making her more suitable than entry-level staff or receptionists. She was the only support staff identified, further solidifying her as the single best contact.\",\n\"search_notes\": \"Conducted thorough searches across the firm's main website, associated blog site (calltherightattorney.com), LinkedIn company profiles, Facebook and Instagram business pages, legal directories (Avvo, FindLaw, Lawyers.com), Ohio Bar Association resources, job postings on Indeed and ZipRecruiter, reviews on Yelp and LawCrossing, and X (Twitter) user and keyword searches. The primary website and directories primarily listed attorneys; only one support staff member (Karen Bundoc) was identified via a dedicated staff profile on the firm's blog site. Social media and other sources yielded no additional staff names or details. Limited information on support staff suggests the firm may not publicly list them extensively.\"\n}\n1 𝕏 post\n61 web pages\n1.9s\nExpert\nSearch for additional staff pages\nExplore other Ohio law firms\nExpand search notes section\nAre you satisfied with Grok's answer?\nLike\nDislike\nHow can Grok help?\nAuto",
