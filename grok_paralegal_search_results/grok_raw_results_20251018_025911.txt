- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True"

"search_notes": "Thoroughly searched the firm's website (mccarthylebit.com) via browsing and site-specific searches, identifying 5 paralegals with profiles. Extended search to LinkedIn via company page and individual profile searches, uncovering 9 additional support staff in target roles. Checked social media (Facebook, Instagram) and legal directories (Avvo, FindLaw, Lawyers.com) but found no additional staff details. No direct emails or phones found for any staff; all emails generated based on the attorney's initial-based pattern. Firm has Creditor & Debtor Rights practice, including foreclosures, relevant to the query."
