SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: DMK@DMKLEGAL.COM
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).

- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True"

Her responsibilities included client communications, case management, and new case handling tasks, aligning with the criteria for handling new client intake in personal injury matters. She appears senior enough based on her detailed duties involving research, drafting, and liaising with clients and external parties.",
"search_notes": "The main website dmklegal.com provided no staff information, with all browsed pages showing insufficient content. No company LinkedIn page was found. Searches across LinkedIn profiles, resume sites (Bold.pro, Success.ai, SignalHire), legal directories (Avvo, Martindale, LawyerLegion), court documents, and other sources revealed only former support staff members, with no current staff identified beyond the attorney. Emails were generated based on common patterns using the firm's domain, as no direct emails were found. The firm appears small (1-5 employees per public data), but no additional names surfaced despite extensive searches."
