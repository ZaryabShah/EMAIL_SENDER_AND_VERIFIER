SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: ddemers@cdgattorneys.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: FORECLOSURE), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Miracle McGowan was selected as the best match because she is the only identified paralegal, making her the most senior support staff likely to handle new client intake, case management, and communications in the foreclosure practice area. Paralegals typically have direct involvement in legal matters and decision-making for new cases, aligning with the criteria for seniority, client responsibilities, and relevant experience.",
"search_notes": "Searched the firm website thoroughly, including homepage, about, and contact pages, which listed attorneys and one office manager but no other support staff. Deep dived into LinkedIn for employee profiles, identifying current and potential support staff. Checked legal directories (Avvo, FindLaw, Lawyers.com), social media (Facebook, Instagram, X), bar associations (OSBA), and general web for mentions, court filings, and news. Limited direct staff info available; most discoveries via LinkedIn. Several past employees found but excluded. Firm confirmed to handle foreclosure via secondary sources like DS News."
