SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: pgp@perantinides.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: PERSONAL_INJURY), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Yvette Bishop was selected as the best match because her role as Legal Administrative Assistant in a personal injury firm likely involves handling client communications, new client intake, and supporting case management, making her senior enough to assist with decisions on new cases in the relevant practice area.",
"search_notes": "The main website had no staff listings despite browsing multiple subpages like attorneys, about us, contact, and blog. Key staff were found via LinkedIn company and employee profile searches. Social media pages on Facebook and Instagram provided no additional staff details. Legal directories listed only attorneys. An old 2012 blog post mentioned some names, but most appear to be former employees or attorneys. No direct emails or phones for staff were found, so emails were generated based on common patterns and the firm domain."
