SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: answersms@dallegal.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: FORECLOSURE), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Stephne Lazarz was selected as the best match due to her senior role as a Foreclosure Specialist, directly aligning with the firm's primary practice area of foreclosure. Her experience as an experienced Legal Assistant with a senior designation indicates she is likely involved in case management, client communications, and handling new matters in foreclosure, making her suitable for decision-making on new cases.",
"search_notes": "The firm website provided general information on firm size and roles but no specific staff names or profiles. LinkedIn searches yielded multiple support staff profiles via search results and snippets, focusing on target roles. One direct email was found via Florida Bar for a registered paralegal. Social media, legal directories, and PDF searches did not reveal additional staff details. Direct browsing of individual LinkedIn profiles was unsuccessful, so relied on search snippets for information."
