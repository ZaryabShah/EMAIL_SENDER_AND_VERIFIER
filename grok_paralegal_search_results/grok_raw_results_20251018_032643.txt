SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: esisalouis@ursinjurylaw.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: WORKERS COMPENSATION), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Sheri Rydzinski was selected as the best match because she holds the position of Case Manager with nearly 6 years of tenure at the firm, indicating seniority and likely involvement in client intake, case handling, and communications in the workers' compensation practice area. This aligns with the criteria for someone senior enough to manage new cases and handle client responsibilities.",
"search_notes": "Primary search on the corrected firm website (nrsinjurylaw.com) revealed no direct listings of support staff, though it mentions over 100 support staff and assigns paralegals/case managers to attorneys. Deep search via LinkedIn employee profiles yielded current staff in target roles. Social media (Instagram, Facebook mentions) and legal directories (Avvo, FindLaw, Lawyers.com) primarily featured attorneys and firm overviews, with no additional support staff identified. Email domain corrected to nrsinjurylaw.com based on firm details; generations follow the attorney's pattern (first initial + last name)."
