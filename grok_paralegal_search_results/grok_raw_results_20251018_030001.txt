SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: sgodenswager@sandhu-law.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: FORECLOSURE), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Shannon Kilbane was selected as the best match due to her role as a paralegal with over 9 years of experience at the firm, plus prior relevant experience in legal support roles. This seniority positions her as the most likely to handle new client intake, make decisions on foreclosure cases, manage client communications, and have deep knowledge of the firm's practice area.",
"search_notes": "The main website provided limited staff details, mentioning only general team composition without specifics. LinkedIn searches yielded the majority of support staff profiles. Legal directories like Avvo and FindLaw listed attorneys but no support staff. Social media searches on Facebook, Instagram, and X did not reveal additional staff mentions. Court filings referenced attorneys only. Email patterns were derived from known attorney and contact emails on the site."
