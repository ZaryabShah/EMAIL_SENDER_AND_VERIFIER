SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: dhunter@nrsinjurylaw.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: PERSONAL_INJURY), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection

Those records will have the name of the attending physician, details of when the injury happened, and information about the injury and what diagnosis/treatment(s) were done during the visit.

Her role involves managing medical records and supporting case building, indicating she is senior enough to handle new client intake and decisions in injury-related matters.",
"search_notes": "Thorough search of the firm's website revealed mentions of support roles but no specific names. LinkedIn searches using targeted queries for roles like paralegal, legal assistant, and case manager yielded multiple current staff profiles. A blog post provided detailed information on Lacey Krizman. Social media and legal directories primarily listed attorneys, with limited additional staff details."
