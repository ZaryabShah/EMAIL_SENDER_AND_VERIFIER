SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: mstavnickY@smdklaw.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: OTHER), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Hope Cloud was selected as the best match because she is a Litigation Paralegal, which aligns with senior paralegal roles having higher priority for handling new client intake, case management, and client communications. The firm's practice includes litigation, and as a paralegal with long tenure at the firm, she is likely senior enough to assist with legal matters in the 'OTHER' practice area. Kathleen Marotta is an administrative assistant, which is lower priority, and Bonnie Korponic's exact role is unclear, making Hope the most suitable.",
"search_notes": "The main website (smdklaw.com) and its subpages (attorneys, about, contact) provided no detailed staff listings, only general mentions of paralegals and support staff in news articles. Deep search via LinkedIn yielded the most results, identifying support staff through employee profiles. Other sources like Facebook, Instagram, Google Business, and legal directories primarily listed attorneys or firm overviews with no additional support staff details. X searches returned no results. Emails were generated based on the consistent pattern observed in attorney emails (firstinitiallastname@smdklaw.com)."
