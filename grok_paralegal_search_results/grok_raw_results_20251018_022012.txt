SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: jepling@reimerlaw.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: FORECLOSURE), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Jonathan Gibby was selected as the best match due to his role as Litigation Paralegal with over 11 years of experience at Reimer Law Co., a firm specializing in foreclosure. This seniority and focus on litigation make him likely to handle new client intake, case decisions, and client communications in the foreclosure practice area.",
"search_notes": "The main website indicates Reimer Law Co. was acquired by Tiffany & Bosco, P.A., with limited staff info available. Primary sources were LinkedIn profiles for current and recent staff in target roles. No direct emails or phones found, so generated based on attorney pattern. Legal directories listed attorneys but not support staff. X searches showed job postings for legal assistants but no specific names. Focused on profiles indicating current employment at Reimer Law Co. or recent relevant experience."
