SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: Marilyn.Rameriz@brockandscott.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: FORECLOSURE), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Selected April Stevens as the best match because as Foreclosure Manager, she is senior and most likely to handle new client intake, decisions about new cases, and client communications specifically in the foreclosure practice area.",
"search_notes": "Searched the main website brockandscott.com via web search and browse, found primarily attorneys and leaders but mentions of legal assistants without names. Deep search on LinkedIn via web search yielded multiple legal assistants and paralegals from profile snippets. Checked Facebook for business page and staff mentions, found additional roles like Foreclosure Manager. Also searched legal directories like Avvo, FindLaw, Lawyers.com, but they listed mostly attorneys. No direct emails or phones found, so generated email options based on the attorney's email pattern."
