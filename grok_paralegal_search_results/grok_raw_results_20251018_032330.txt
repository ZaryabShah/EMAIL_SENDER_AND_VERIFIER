SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: ILOH@memg.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: OTHER CIVIL), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL:

- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection

This makes her likely to handle new client intake, make decisions about new cases, and manage client communications in the civil debt collection practice area.",
"search_notes": "The provided website memg.com yielded no content, likely due to an OCR error in the query. Research linked Nevenka Pavlovic to Midland Credit Management (MCM), with official website midlandcredit.com and email domain mcmcg.com from sources like ZoomInfo. No staff on main website; paralegals and support staff found via LinkedIn profile searches on web. No direct emails or phones available, so generated using observed pattern (firstinitiallastname@mcmcg.com as primary). Checked legal directories and court filings for additional context. Focused on legal support roles in debt collection (civil matters)."
