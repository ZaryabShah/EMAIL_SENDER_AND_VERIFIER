SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: notice@clunkhoose.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: FORECLOSURE), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Maria Nicol was selected as the best match due to her long tenure (over 20 years) as a Legal Assistant at the firm, making her highly experienced in handling foreclosure matters, likely including new client intake, case management, and client communications in this practice area. She is senior enough to potentially make decisions or coordinate on new cases.",
"search_notes": "The main website lists only attorneys, no support staff. Deep search on LinkedIn revealed several current and former staff profiles. Additional sources like Datanyze, ZoomInfo, and ALFN directory provided more names and titles. No direct emails or phones found for staff; emails generated based on observed patterns from attorney emails (e.g., firstinitiallastname@clunkhoose.com). Social media and legal directories yielded limited additional info. Focused on current roles in target categories."
