SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: Apal@216lawyers.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: PERSONAL_INJURY), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

Used web searches on LinkedIn to identify Shannon Smith (Paralegal), Mikayla Davidson (Legal Assistant), and Linsey Schepis (Legal Marketing Manager). Discovered Emily Ponti (Case Manager) from a Yelp review mentioning her role in client updates. Social media (Facebook, Instagram) and other directories yielded no additional staff information. No direct emails or phones found, so generated based on attorney's email pattern."
