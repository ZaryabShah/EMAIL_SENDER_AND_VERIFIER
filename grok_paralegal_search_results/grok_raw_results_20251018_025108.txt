SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: collections@weinerlaw.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: DEBT_COLLECTION), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Allison Vasarab was selected as the best match because her role as Paralegal Collections Specialist directly aligns with the firm's debt collection practice area. She is likely involved in handling case details, client communications, and new matters in collections, making her senior enough for intake and decisions in this specific area.",
"search_notes": "Thorough search of the firm's website revealed a leadership team page with several support staff managers and analysts. LinkedIn searches uncovered multiple paralegal profiles and a work anniversary post highlighting long-tenured staff, including paralegals. No direct emails or phones found beyond general firm contact; emails generated based on patterns. Legal directories provided attorney info but limited support staff details."
