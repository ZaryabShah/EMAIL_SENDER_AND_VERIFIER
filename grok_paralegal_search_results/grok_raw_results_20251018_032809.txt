SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: isugerman@ralaw.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: DECLARATORY JUDGMENT), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Carla Thoman was selected as the best match because she is a paralegal based in the Akron office, matching the location of attorney Irving B. Sugerman. As a paralegal, she holds a senior support role likely involved in client intake and case management for practice areas like declaratory judgment, which involves litigation. Other candidates are either in different locations or lower-level roles like secretaries, making her the most suitable for handling new client matters in the relevant area.",
"search_notes": "The firm's website (ralaw.com) provided no details on support staff, only attorney profiles. Extensive searches on LinkedIn yielded the majority of results through targeted queries for roles and firm name. Social media (Facebook, Instagram) and legal directories (Avvo, FindLaw, Lawyers.com) offered no additional staff information. Focused on current employees; excluded former ones. Generated emails based on the attorney's pattern for consistency."
