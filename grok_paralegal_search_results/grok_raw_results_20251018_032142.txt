SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:

- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection

This aligns with the criteria for someone senior enough to manage legal matters in the relevant practice area.",
"search_notes": "The main website (midlandcredit.com) was browsed but only executive leadership was listed, with no support staff details. Extensive use of web searches and snippets from LinkedIn profiles identified multiple legal support staff. Domain confirmed as mcmcg.com from sources related to the attorney. No direct emails or phones found, so generated based on common patterns. Social media and directories yielded no additional staff beyond LinkedIn results."
