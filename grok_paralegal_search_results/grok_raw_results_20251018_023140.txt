SPECIFIC EMAIL GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:
- Attorney email pattern: Bcampbell@elkandelk.com
- Extract domain from attorney email and use for all staff emails if it is right/accurate coz sometimes email's person name or domain can be little miscalculated because of OCR issues mostly it is accurate (domain).
- For "John Smith" generate these patterns: ["john.smith@domain.com", "jsmith@domain.com", "john@domain.com"]
- Always provide 2-3 email options per person (more if unsure)
- Mark confidence level: "found" (actual email found), "generated_high" (strong pattern match), "generated_medium" (reasonable guess), "generated_low" (last resort)

BEST MATCH SELECTION CRITERIA:
Based on the case information (Practice Area: PERSONAL_INJURY), select the staff member who would be:
1. Most likely to handle new client intake for this practice area
2. Senior enough to make decisions about new cases  
3. Specifically responsible for client communications
4. Has experience in the relevant practice area

IMPORTANT: Be thorough and creative! Many firms hide staff information, so use multiple search angles. If the main website is limited, definitely search social media and professional networks. We need to find as many legal support staff as possible!

CRITICAL: 
- ALWAYS generate email options even if no direct emails found
- ALWAYS select exactly ONE person as "Best_match": "True" 
- ALWAYS explain your reasoning for the best match selection
- MUST MAKE SURE: ALWAYS THINK HARDER

"best_contact_reasoning": "Jacqueline Reblin was selected as the best match because her role as a Litigation Paralegal involves handling both litigation and pre-litigation files, preparing legal documents, reviewing medical records, and preparing trial exhibits. In a personal injury firm, this indicates direct involvement in case management, client-related tasks, and potentially new client intake or communications, making her senior enough to handle or influence decisions on new cases in the personal injury practice area.",
"search_notes": "Thorough search of the firm website revealed attorney profiles but no direct staff listings; a 2019 blog post provided names of certified paralegals. LinkedIn searches uncovered additional current paralegals and an administrative assistant. Social media and legal directories yielded no additional staff details. No direct emails or phones found for staff; all emails generated based on attorney pattern."
